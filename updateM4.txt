For this update, I implemented most of the protocols for REGULAR user and MODERATOR user. 

- REGULAR user can use NAME <name>, MSG <msg>, and EXIT commands.
- I can send messages between clients
- For MODERATOR user, the password is iAmModerator. They can BAN names and KICK connected clients and also set a TOPIC. When kicking a client though, I still have to manually close the socket of the client kicked but they can't write messages anymore because the window chat infinitely loops when they enter something.
